## Insight

1. The closing , open, high and low all went down in 2016 because-
    
    1. Trump has said that he would impose a 45% tariff on Chinese produced goods along with many other countries. This of course would           have a major negative impact on Apple in multiple ways.
    
    2. KGI analyst Ming-Chi Kuo published a report saying that he expects iPhone suppliers to decrease shipments by 5% to 15% in November         or December. What is interesting is that he is keeping his iPhone unit forecast of 70 to 75 million units.
    
    3. Apple’s December quarter revenue guidance was $76 to $78 billion, which at the mid-point will be a 1.5% increase from the prior             year. However this year’s holiday quarter is 14 weeks vs. the typical 13 weeks so an extra week should provide a 4% to 7%     revenue         bump which would mean that sales on an adjusted basis could be down year over year. 
    
    4. Apple sold 45.5 million iPhones in the September quarter, which was down 2% from the 48 million sold a year before. 
    
    5. Apple did call out that iPhone 7 demand has significantly outplaced supply but keep in mind that the iPhone 7 had 9 days of sales        in the September quarter and a full quarter of the iPhone SE vs. a year ago the iPhone 6s only had two selling days before the          end of the quarter and there was no SE equivalent.
    
2. The closing , open, high and low all went down in 2020 because-

    1. Apple’s got off to a strong start this year after reporting solid December quarter earnings and a record high for the stock.
    
    2. Apple’s stock has fallen nearly 19% from its record high. 
    
    3. Chief Executive Tim Cook lauded the company’s “blockbuster quarter” for the three months that ended in December 2019, in which           the company posted market beating earnings and revenue. The iPhone 11 series appeared to be doing well, especially in China, one         of the company’s most critical markets. 
    
    4. Chief Executive Tim Cook lauded the company’s “blockbuster quarter” for the three months that ended in December 2019, in which            the company posted market beating earnings and revenue. The iPhone 11 series appeared to be doing well, especially in China,            one of the company’s most critical markets. 
    
    5. On Feb. 17, Apple said it did not expect to meet the revenue guidance for the March quarter of $63 billion to $67 billion. China         was mostly to blame.The coronavirus forced the annual Lunar New Year holiday to be extended. That meant Apple stores and the              factories that make iPhones, run by Foxconn, remained shut for longer. Production wasn’t happening and demand had waned. 
    
3. 2018 and 2019 is highly sucessful for apple and they are somewhat identical in nature

4. 2017 had the largest volume of stock trade

5. Ending months in general prove to be a big hit because according to me in september Iphone is released.
